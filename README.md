# mongo-beacon
### A simple python beacon for checking Mongo status. ###


So we wanted to write a really light beacon that would check the status of our Mongo replica sets.  We will keep adding to this but for now it's solely used for sending beacon messages to let us know which server is primary in the replica set.
